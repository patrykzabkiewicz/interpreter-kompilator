# C-compiler
Yet another C compiler for masses. Brings power to the people.

Basic Concepts
--------------

Project is inteneded to provide full spectrum view of the compiler
output for the given architecture of processors and device chips.

Compile with:
 - Bison
 - Flex

Currently we are supporting virtual assembler language that can be
executed on our own virtual machine. Just for scientific purporses.
You or we can put there output of any kind of specific assembler
for your current processor or chip that you developed.

If you want additional changes to output you specific assembler
we can provide paid support for it!
